<h1>The Best Movies According to Joyce</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>The soundtrack is gorgeous! I was lucky enough to see a Studio Ghibli live concert conducted by Joe Hisaishi.</p>
<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>My comfort movie, I first saw this as an elementary school student in China.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>It was difficult choosing between this and Princess Mononoke! But I love Howl and Sophie, and Calcifer is amazing.</p>
