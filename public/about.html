<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a fulltime Software Developer Engineer currently working in Amazon Advertising. Recently, I graduated from Cornell 
  University, class of 2022, with a major in Computer Science. I've started taking a Web Development course on Udemy and 
  plan to continue with Android development and scripting courses after this one! Some of my favorite class at Cornell were 
  Game Development, Computer Graphics, and Data Visualizations. I also TA'd for Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming.

<p>At Amazon, I lead the migration of one of my team's main services to a new tech stack. I designed and reviewed the migration 
  plan with my team and communicated with over 20 stakeholders from client teams affected by the migration. I also audited, proposed 
  updates for, and revamped my team's hardware resources, alarms, monitors, and dashboards to improve our overall performance 
  and operational excellence.

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing and gaming! On any given evening after work, you can usually find me shouting from the 
  top of a bouldering wall at the Cliffs or tapping away at some visually-stunning game at home (currently playing Honkai Star Rail!). 
  I also enjoy baking a lemon tart on occasion, producing a decadant chocolate cake for a birthday on request, and have been dubbed 
  the 'bread supplier' by my old martial arts club. I hope to try out new activities like dance or pottery in the future as well!
